## 110: NetDataContractSerializer fails to deserialize a ConcurrentDictionary serialized with by a different .NET version

### Scope
Minor

### Version Introduced
4.5.1

### Source Analyzer Status
Planned

### Change Description
By design, the [NetDataContractSerializer](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.runtime.serialization.netdatacontractserializer.aspx) can be used only if both the serializing and deserializing ends share the same CLR types. Therefore, it is not guaranteed that an object serialized with one version of the .NET Framework can be deserialized by a different version.

ConcurrentDictionary is a type that is known to not to deserialize correctly if serialized with the .NET Framework 4.5 or earlier and deserialized with the .NET Framework 4.5.1 or later.

- [ ] Quirked
- [ ] Build-time break

### Recommended Action
There are a number of possible work-arounds for this issue:

- Upgrade the serializing computer to use the .NET Framework 4.5.1, as well.
- Use DataContractSerializer instead of NetDataContractSerializer as this does not expect the exact same CLR types at both serializing and deserializing ends.
- Use Dictionary instead of ConcurrentDictionary since it does not exhibit this particular 4.5->4.5.1 break.

### Affected APIs
* `M:System.Runtime.Serialization.NetDataContractSerializer.Deserialize(System.IO.Stream)`
