## 137: Only Tls 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2 protocols supported in System.Net.ServicePointManager and System.Net.Security.SslStream 

### Scope
Minor

### Version Introduced
4.6

### Source Analyzer Status
Planned

### Change Description
Starting with the .NET Framework 4.6, the `System.Net.ServicePointManager` and `System.Net.Security.SslStream` classes are only allowed to use one of the following three protocols: Tls1.0, Tls1.1, or Tls1.2. The SSL3.0 protocol and RC4 cipher are not supported. 

- [x] Quirked
- [ ] Build-time break

### Recommended Action
The recommended mitigation is to upgrade the sever-side app to Tls1.0, Tls1.1, or Tls1.2. If this is not feasible, or if client apps are broken, the AppContext class can be used to opt out of this feature in either of two ways: 

1. By programmatically setting compat switches on the AppContext, as explained [here](TBD)
2. By adding the following line to the `<runtime>` section of the app.config file: `<AppContextSwitchOverrides value="Switch.System.Net.DontEnableSchUseStrongCrypto=true"/>`;

### Affected APIs
* `F:System.Net.SecurityProtocolType.Ssl3`
* `F:System.Security.Authentication.SslProtocols.None`
* `F:System.Security.Authentication.SslProtocols.Ssl2`
* `F:System.Security.Authentication.SslProtocols.Ssl3`
